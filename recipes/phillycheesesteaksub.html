<h2> Description</h2>
<p>
    A Philly Cheesesteak is a sandwich made from slices of
    beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll.
    It's a popular regional food in the Northeast.
</p>
<p>
    The Philly Cheesesteak has its origins in Philadelphia
    where hotdog stand owners decided to make a sandwich from
    grilled onions and chopped beef for their own lunch.
    While they were eating, a taxi driver stopped by and requested
    one for himself and recommended they start selling this sandwhich
    with cheese on it.
