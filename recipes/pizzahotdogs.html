<h2> Description</h2>
<p id="pone">Pizza Hot Dogs are a combination of hot dogs on a bun
    that are topped with cheese, pepperoni, and tomato sauce
</p>
<p id="ptwo">
    The recipe was made famous by the shop Orange Julius.
    Orange Julius used to be a mall store that served
    smoothies and different hot dogs such as the 
    Chicago Dog, the Miami Dog, and the Pizza Dog. It 
    faded into obscurity in the middle of the 2000's and 
    returned to making smoothies.
